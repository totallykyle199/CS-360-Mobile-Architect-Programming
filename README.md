-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
 
 The requirments for the Event tracker app was to have a login screen, a screen to add information on a grid or list that stays persistant, and a screen to request notification permission. The app is designed to have a place for users to keep track of their upcoming events.

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The main screens to support the user needs are the list view of all events and the focused view of the specific event. THe main screen allows the user to view all the events they have included and by tapping on an event the user can make changes or delete the event. The apps design was made to be simple to use and straight forward to allow quick access to all the features of the app.

-How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

When coding my app I try to keep the user needs in mind. For example when coding the list of events to be added I wanted the database to update the screen as soon as the user taps a button instead of only updating after the app is refreshed. Another coding example was to include small pop ups notifying the user if the task they wanted to do was successful or not.

-How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code as soon as I finished a section of the app. I tested frequently to ensure what I just coded worked to make testing other features of the app more easy. It is easier to test and fix what I know is broken than trying to go back through my code searching for what went wrong.

-Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

My original desiugn of the app had the main screen containing all the buttons the user would need, including updating, deleting, and adding new events. This did not work with the design and made the screen crowded. Instead I had to create a separate screen that would allow the user to update or delete the event they have tapped on.

-In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was successful in creating a database that the user can add events to that will populate a list of all events on their screen. This database also stayed persistant even if the app was closed.
